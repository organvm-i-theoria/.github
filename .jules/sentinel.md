## 2025-02-18 - [Fix Code Injection in GitHub Actions]
**Vulnerability:** Unmitigated Code Injection in `.github/workflows/bulk-pr-operations.yml`. The workflow interpolated user inputs directly into a JavaScript code block executed by `actions/github-script`. A malicious user with workflow dispatch permissions could inject arbitrary JavaScript code.
**Learning:** GitHub Actions `github-script` action executes code in a Node.js context. Direct interpolation of inputs (e.g., `const val = '${{ inputs.val }}'`) is dangerous because the input is evaluated before the script runs, allowing code injection (e.g., input `'; system('rm -rf /'); //`).
**Prevention:** Always use environment variables to pass inputs to `github-script`. Map inputs to `env:` in the workflow step, and access them via `process.env.VAR_NAME` within the script. This ensures data is treated as data, not code.
