# ivi374forivi Organization

> **Default Community Health Files and Configurations**

Welcome to the **ivi374forivi** organization! We believe in open collaboration,
transparent development, and building innovative solutions through high-quality
software and inclusive community practices.

## About This Repository

This is the special `.github` repository for our organization. It serves as the
central hub for:

- **Default community health files** that apply to all repositories
- **Standardized templates** for issues and pull requests
- **Reusable workflow templates** for CI/CD and automation
- **Organization-wide configuration** and documentation standards
- **Living Document System** - AI-driven governance and management protocols
- **Mouthpiece Filter System** - Transform natural human expression into AI-optimized prompts

When a repository in our organization doesn't have its own community health files, GitHub automatically uses the defaults from this repository.

> **Is this the right repository for these functions?** See our [Repository Purpose Analysis](docs/architecture/REPOSITORY_PURPOSE_ANALYSIS.md) for a detailed explanation of why this `.github` repository is the appropriate location for organization-wide governance, templates, and the Living Document System.

## Our Mission

At **ivi374forivi**, we are committed to:

- **Openness**: Developing in the open with transparency
- **Collaboration**: Welcoming diverse perspectives and contributors
- **Quality**: Delivering well-tested, documented, and maintainable software
- **Respect**: Maintaining an inclusive environment for all
- **Innovation**: Encouraging experimentation and creative problem-solving

### Mouthpiece Filter System

**Transform your natural human expression into AI-optimized prompts.**

The Mouthpiece Filter System allows you to write and speak in your authentic voice—with all its imperfections, metaphors, and humanity—and automatically transforms that input into structured, clear prompts that AI systems can understand and act upon.

> _"Write like a human. Let the filter handle the rest."_

#### What It Does

- **Preserves Your Voice**: Keeps your unique style, metaphors, and emotional context
- **Extracts Intent**: Understands what you mean, not just what you say
- **Structures Information**: Organizes thoughts into clear, actionable formats
- **Optimizes for AI**: Creates prompts that AI systems can process effectively

#### Components

- **Filter Script** (`scripts/mouthpiece_filter.py`) - CLI transformation engine
- **Chat Mode** (`chatmodes/mouthpiece.chatmode.md`) - Interactive AI persona
- **Prompt Template** (`prompts/mouthpiece-transform.prompt.md`) - Quick transformations
- **Documentation** ([MOUTHPIECE_README.md](MOUTHPIECE_README.md)) - Complete guide

#### Quick Start

```bash
# Transform natural writing into structured prompts
python scripts/mouthpiece_filter.py "your natural thoughts here"

# Example
python scripts/mouthpiece_filter.py "need something that watches APIs and alerts when they fail"
```

#### 🚀 Workflow Optimization (NEW!)

**All workflows have been optimized for security, performance, and cost efficiency.**

- **[Workflow Standards](.github/WORKFLOW_STANDARDS.md)**: Comprehensive standards and best practices
- **[Optimization Report](.github/WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZATION_REPORT.md)**: Detailed metrics and analysis  
- **[Quick Start Guide](.github/WORKFLOW_OPTIMIZATION_QUICKSTART.md)**: Get started with optimized workflows

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **Security**: SHA-pinned actions, minimal permissions, deprecated syntax removed
- ✅ **Performance**: 30-60% faster builds with caching and path filters
- ✅ **Cost**: 25-32% reduction (estimated $225-325/month savings)
- ✅ **Reliability**: Timeouts, concurrency controls, better error handling

**Stats:** 8/73 workflows optimized | 83% reduction in health check costs | 0 deprecated syntax

### Automation Configuration

- **[dependabot.yml](dependabot.yml)** - Organization-wide Dependabot configurat
  ion for:
  - npm (JavaScript/Node.js)
  - pip (Python)
  - GitHub Actions
  - Docker
  - Go modules
  - Composer (PHP)

### Organization Profile

The [profile/README.md](profile/README.md) file is displayed on our organization
's public profile page.

## Getting Started

### For New Repositories

1. **Automatic Inheritance**: New repositories automatically inherit community h
   ealth files from this repository if they don't have their own versions.

2. **Using Workflow Templates**:

   - Navigate to **Actions → New workflow** in your repository
   - Look for templates in the "By your organization" section
   - Select, customize, and commit the workflow

3. **Setup Checklist**: Follow the [Repository Setup Checklist](docs/REPOSITORY_SETUP_CHECKLIST.md) for comprehensive guidance.

### For Existing Repositories

1. **Adopt Standards**: Review organization standards from this repository
2. **Enable Workflows**: Copy desired workflow templates to `.github/workflows/` in your repo
3. **Configure Dependabot**: Copy [dependabot.yml](dependabot.yml) to `.github/` in your repository
4. **Apply Labels**: Use [LABELS.md](docs/LABELS.md) to standardize issue labels
5. **Enable Branch Protection**: Follow [BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](docs/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md) guidelines

### Customizing Templates

Individual repositories can override these defaults by creating their own versio
ns of any file. The repository-level file will take precedence over the organiza
tion default.

## AI-Driven Organization Management

This organization implements an advanced AI-driven GitHub management system with
8 core modules:

1. **Organization & Repository Administration** - Setup, access control, and bra
   nch protection
2. **Project Management & Workflow Automation** - Boards, issues, labels, and au
   tomation
3. **CI/CD & Development Lifecycle** - Build pipelines, testing, and deployment
4. **Security & Compliance Operations** - Vulnerability management and complianc
   e
5. **Documentation & Knowledge Base** - Maintaining comprehensive documentation
6. **Ecosystem Integration & Architecture** - Monitoring service dependencies
7. **Observability & System Health** - Analytics and system monitoring
8. **Strategic Analysis & Risk Mitigation** - Proactive risk identification

Read the full protocol: [AI Implementation Notes](docs/guides/AI_IMPLEMENTATION_NOTES.txt) | [Implementation Guide](docs/AI_IMPLEMENTATION_GUIDE.md)

### Active Health Monitoring

The organization now features **automated health monitoring** that brings the AI protocol to life:

- **🔍 Web Crawler** - Continuously analyzes organization health, validates documentation links, and maps the ecosystem
- **📊 Health Dashboard** - Real-time visualization of repository health, workflow coverage, and Copilot customizations
- **🔦 Blind Spot Detection** - Identifies unknown risks and unmaintained areas
- **💥 Shatter Point Analysis** - Detects single points of failure in workflows and infrastructure
- **⚡ Automated Reporting** - Weekly health reports with critical issue alerts

**Current Stats**: 32 workflows • 324 Copilot customizations • 109 technologies supported
