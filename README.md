# .github

This is the special `.github` repository for the **ivi374forivi** organization. It provides default community health files and configurations that apply to all repositories in the organization.

## What's Inside

### Organization Profile

The `profile/README.md` file displays on the organization's public profile page, introducing visitors to the organization.

### Community Health Files

These files provide default templates for all repositories in the organization:

- **CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md** - Defines standards for community interaction
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Guidelines for contributing to projects
- **FUNDING.yml** - Funding and sponsorship configuration
- **GOVERNANCE.md** - Project governance and decision-making processes
- **LICENSE** - License terms for the organization's projects (MIT License)
- **MANIFESTO.md** - Core principles and values of the organization
- **SECURITY.md** - Security policy and vulnerability reporting process
- **SUPPORT.md** - How to get help and support

### Issue and Pull Request Templates

- **ISSUE_TEMPLATE/** - Templates for creating issues (bug reports, feature requests)
- **PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md** - Template for pull requests

### Workflow Templates

The `workflow-templates/` directory contains reusable GitHub Actions workflow templates that can be used across repositories.

## How It Works

When a repository in the organization doesn't have its own community health files, GitHub automatically uses the files from this `.github` repository as defaults.

## Customization

Individual repositories can override these defaults by creating their own versions of these files.
