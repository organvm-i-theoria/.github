## Sanitization Techniques

### Redaction Methods
- **Complete Removal**: Delete sensitive data entirely
- **Masking**: Replace with asterisks or placeholder text (e.g., `***@***.com`)
- **Tokenization**: Replace with non-sensitive tokens
- **Hashing**: One-way cryptographic hashing for identifiers
- **Encryption**: Encrypt data for authorized access only
- **Generalization**: Replace specific values with ranges or categories
- **Synthetic Replacement**: Generate realistic but fake data

### Anonymization Strategies
- **K-Anonymity**: Ensure individuals cannot be distinguished within a group
- **Differential Privacy**: Add statistical noise to protect individuals
- **Pseudonymization**: Replace identifiers with pseudonyms
- **Data Aggregation**: Summarize data to prevent identification
- **Data Perturbation**: Slightly modify values while preserving utility
- **Sampling**: Use representative subsets instead of full datasets

### Validation Techniques
- Pattern matching with regular expressions
- Keyword scanning for sensitive terms
- Machine learning-based PII detection
- Schema analysis for sensitive columns
- Compliance rule validation
- Manual review of high-risk areas
- Automated sanitization testing

## Sanitization Workflow

### 1. Assessment Phase
- Identify sensitive data types and locations
- Classify data by sensitivity level
- Determine compliance requirements
- Define sanitization scope
- Assess impact of sanitization
- Plan for data retention policies

### 2. Planning Phase
- Select appropriate sanitization techniques
- Define sanitization rules and patterns
- Create test cases for validation
- Prepare rollback procedures
- Document sanitization approach
- Obtain necessary approvals

### 3. Execution Phase
- Create backups before sanitization
- Apply sanitization rules systematically
- Validate sanitization effectiveness
- Test functionality after sanitization
- Document changes and exceptions
- Generate sanitization reports

### 4. Verification Phase
- Conduct manual spot checks
- Run automated validation scans
- Verify compliance requirements met
- Test with sample queries
- Review audit logs
- Confirm no data leakage

### 5. Documentation Phase
- Document sanitization procedures
- Record what was sanitized and how
- Maintain sanitization audit trail
- Update data dictionaries
- Create compliance reports
- Document exceptions and rationale

### Common Data Patterns to Sanitize

#### Email Addresses
```regex
[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}
```

#### Phone Numbers (US Format)
```regex
\b\d{3}[-.]?\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}\b
|\(\d{3}\)\s*\d{3}[-.]?\d{4}
```

#### Social Security Numbers
```regex
\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b
```

#### Credit Card Numbers
```regex
\b(?:\d{4}[-\s]?){3}\d{4}\b
```

#### IP Addresses (IPv4)
```regex
\b(?:\d{1,3}\.){3}\d{1,3}\b
```

#### API Keys and Tokens
```regex
(?:api[_-]?key|token|secret|password)[\s:=]+['\"]?([a-zA-Z0-9_\-]{20,})
```

#### AWS Keys
```regex
AKIA[0-9A-Z]{16}
```

#### GitHub Tokens
```regex
ghp_[a-zA-Z0-9]{36}
```

## Sanitization Use Cases

### Test Data Generation
**Scenario**: Need realistic test data without using production PII
**Approach**:
1. Extract schema from production database
2. Generate synthetic data matching patterns
3. Maintain referential integrity
4. Populate test environment
5. Validate data realism

### Public Code Release
**Scenario**: Open-sourcing internal repository
**Approach**:
1. Scan for hardcoded secrets and credentials
2. Remove internal documentation and comments
3. Sanitize example data and configuration
4. Clean commit history if necessary
5. Review and sanitize issues/PRs
6. Validate compliance before release

### Compliance Request
**Scenario**: User requests data deletion under GDPR
**Approach**:
1. Identify all user data across systems
2. Determine legal retention requirements
3. Sanitize or delete as appropriate
4. Update audit logs
5. Confirm deletion to user
6. Document compliance actions

### Security Incident Response
**Scenario**: Leaked credentials in public repository
**Approach**:
1. Immediately rotate exposed credentials
2. Identify all instances in commit history
3. Use BFG Repo-Cleaner or git-filter-repo
4. Force push cleaned history
5. Notify collaborators to rebase
6. Document incident and response

### Data Sharing with Partners
**Scenario**: Share analytics data with third party
**Approach**:
1. Identify PII in dataset
2. Apply anonymization techniques
3. Aggregate data where possible
4. Test re-identification risk
5. Create data sharing agreement
6. Document sanitization process

## Tools and Commands

### Git History Cleaning
```bash
# Remove file from entire history
git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f path/to/sensitive-file' HEAD

# BFG Repo-Cleaner (faster alternative)
bfg --delete-files sensitive-file.txt
bfg --replace-text passwords.txt

# git-filter-repo (recommended)
git filter-repo --invert-paths --path path/to/sensitive-file
```

### Secrets Scanning
```bash
# TruffleHog
trufflehog git https://github.com/user/repo

# GitLeaks
gitleaks detect --source .

# GitHub secret scanning (built-in)
# Check Security > Secret scanning alerts
```

### Data Sanitization Scripts
```python
# Example PII redaction
import re

def sanitize_email(text):
    return re.sub(r'[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}', 
                  '[EMAIL REDACTED]', text)

def sanitize_ssn(text):
    return re.sub(r'\b\d{3}-\d{2}-\d{4}\b', '[SSN REDACTED]', text)
```

## Usage Examples

- "Sanitize the database export file before sharing with QA team"
- "Remove all PII from application logs"
- "Clean up the commit history to remove exposed API keys"
- "Prepare anonymized dataset for research purposes"
- "Sanitize user data in response to GDPR deletion request"
- "Review and clean this repository before open-sourcing"
- "Generate synthetic test data based on production schema"

## Best Practices

1. **Backups First**: Always create backups before sanitization
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Validate sanitization doesn't break functionality
3. **Document Everything**: Maintain audit trail of sanitization activities
4. **Automate**: Use scripts and tools for consistent sanitization
5. **Validate**: Verify sanitization effectiveness with testing
6. **Monitor**: Continuously scan for new sensitive data
7. **Train Team**: Ensure team understands sanitization requirements
8. **Regular Audits**: Periodically review sanitization processes
9. **Compliance Focus**: Stay current with regulatory requirements
10. **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple sanitization techniques together
