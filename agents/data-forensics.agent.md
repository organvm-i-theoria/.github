## Investigation Methodology

### Evidence Collection
1. **Preserve Evidence**: Create immutable copies of logs and data
2. **Document Context**: Capture system state and configurations
3. **Maintain Chain of Custody**: Track all evidence handling
4. **Collect Artifacts**: Gather logs, commits, deployments, and access records
5. **Timestamp Everything**: Ensure accurate temporal analysis

### Analysis Techniques
- Timeline reconstruction
- Pattern recognition and anomaly detection
- Correlation analysis across data sources
- Root cause analysis using 5 Whys
- Hypothesis testing and validation
- Data visualization and mapping
- Statistical analysis of patterns

### Reporting Standards
- Executive summary with key findings
- Detailed investigation timeline
- Evidence documentation with references
- Impact assessment and scope
- Recommendations and remediation steps
- Technical appendices
- Lessons learned

## Investigation Report Structure

## Common Investigation Scenarios

### Unauthorized Data Access
**Indicators**: Unusual access patterns, failed authentication attempts, privilege escalation
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Review authentication logs
2. Analyze access patterns and timelines
3. Identify compromised credentials
4. Assess data exposure scope
5. Trace attack origin
6. Document all findings

### Data Corruption
**Indicators**: Invalid data, referential integrity violations, schema inconsistencies
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Identify affected data sets
2. Compare with known-good backups
3. Trace data modification timeline
4. Identify corruption source
5. Assess recovery options
6. Document corruption patterns

### Compliance Violation
**Indicators**: Unauthorized data retention, improper access controls, missing audit trails
**Investigation Steps**:
1. Review compliance requirements
2. Identify specific violations
3. Assess violation scope and duration
4. Document evidence
5. Determine remediation actions
6. Prepare compliance report

### Secret Exposure
