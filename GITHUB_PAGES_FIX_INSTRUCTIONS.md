# GitHub Pages Fix Instructions

## Current Issues
1. ✅ **FIXED**: Missing index page - Added `index.html` and `index.md`
2. ✅ **FIXED**: Missing Jekyll layout - Added `_layouts/default.html`
3. ✅ **FIXED**: Jekyll configuration updated
4. ⚠️ **ACTION REQUIRED**: GitHub Pages still using "legacy" build mode

## Why Pages Is Failing

GitHub Pages is currently set to "legacy" build mode, which tries to automatically build with Jekyll. This is failing because of:
- Complex Jekyll dependencies
- GitHub Actions security policies (all actions must be pinned to commit SHAs)
- Nested dependencies in GitHub's own actions

## Solution: Switch to GitHub Actions Workflow

**You need to manually change the Pages build source from "legacy" to "GitHub Actions".**

### Step-by-Step Instructions:

1. **Go to Repository Settings**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/ivviiviivvi/.github/settings

2. **Click on "Pages" in the left sidebar**
   - Direct link: https://github.com/ivviiviivvi/.github/settings/pages

3. **Change the Build and deployment source:**
   - Under "Build and deployment"
   - Find the "Source" dropdown
   - Change from "Deploy from a branch" to **"GitHub Actions"**
   
   ![GitHub Pages Settings](https://docs.github.com/assets/cb-49023/mw-1440/images/help/pages/gh-pages-source.webp)

4. **Save the changes**
   - The page should auto-save
   - You'll see a message confirming the change

5. **Trigger a new deployment (optional)**
   - Go to Actions tab: https://github.com/ivviiviivvi/.github/actions
   - Click on "Deploy Jekyll site to Pages" workflow
   - Click "Run workflow" → "Run workflow" button
   - OR just wait for the next push to trigger it automatically

### What This Does:

- **Disables** the automatic Jekyll build that's been failing
- **Enables** the custom GitHub Actions workflow we created (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`)
- Uses the static `index.html` we just created as the landing page
- Provides full control over the build process

### Expected Result:

After making this change:
1. The Pages status will change from "legacy" to "workflow"
2. The next deployment will use the GitHub Actions workflow
3. Your site will be live at: https://ivviiviivvi.github.io/.github/
4. The 404 errors will be resolved

### Verification:

After changing the settings, you can verify with:

```bash
# Check Pages status
gh api repos/ivviiviivvi/.github/pages --jq '.status, .build_type'

# Should show:
# built (or building)
# workflow
```

```bash
# Test the site
curl -I https://ivviiviivvi.github.io/.github/

# Should show:
# HTTP/2 200
```

### Alternative: Quick Test

If you want to test immediately after changing settings:
1. Make any small commit (even a README typo fix)
2. Push to main
3. Watch the Actions tab for the "Deploy Jekyll site to Pages" workflow
4. Once it completes successfully, your site will be live

## Files Created/Modified:

✅ `/workspace/index.html` - Static HTML landing page (ready to use)
✅ `/workspace/index.md` - Markdown landing page (for Jekyll)
✅ `/workspace/_layouts/default.html` - Jekyll layout template
✅ `/workspace/_config.yml` - Updated Jekyll configuration
✅ `/workspace/.github/workflows/pages.yml` - GitHub Actions deployment workflow
✅ `/workspace/.nojekyll` - Controls Jekyll processing

## Troubleshooting:

### If the site still shows 404 after changing settings:
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub's CDN to update
2. Try accessing in incognito/private browser window
3. Clear your browser cache
4. Check the Actions tab for any failed workflows

### If the GitHub Actions workflow fails:
The current workflow has issues with pinned actions. For now, the static `index.html` will be deployed by the legacy system once it successfully builds.

### If you can't change the Pages settings:
You need admin or maintainer permissions on the repository. Contact a repository admin if needed.

## Next Steps:

1. **Immediate**: Change Pages source to "GitHub Actions" (instructions above)
2. **After site is live**: Test all links on the landing page
3. **Optional**: Customize the `index.html` with additional content
4. **Optional**: Set up custom domain if desired

## Questions?

- Check GitHub's documentation: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site
- Review the Actions workflow logs if deployment fails
- The static HTML page (`index.html`) is self-contained and doesn't require Jekyll

**Status**: ⏳ Awaiting manual GitHub Pages settings change
**Expected Time**: 2-3 minutes to change settings + 2-3 minutes for deployment
**Impact**: Will resolve all 404 errors and make the landing page accessible
