Integration Tests for Month 3 Advanced Features

Tests all Month 3 implementations (Week 9-12):
- Auto-merge system with safety checks
- Intelligent routing with multi-factor assignment
- Self-healing workflows with retry logic
- Proactive maintenance with ML timing
- Enhanced analytics with 85% accuracy
- Operational procedures (SLA monitoring, incident response)

Usage:
    pytest tests/integration/test_month3_advanced.py -v
    pytest tests/integration/test_month3_advanced.py::TestAutoMerge -v

NOTE: Many of these tests check for Month 3 features that are not yet implemented.
      Tests are marked as xfail until the corresponding features are built.
