# Month 3 Master Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the comprehensive plan for Month 3 of the automation optimization initiative, focusing on scaling, reliability, and intelligent automation.

## Goals & Targets

### Scale Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Repositories Under Management | **15 repositories** | 8 |
| Workflow Coverage | 100% | 85% |
| Active Monitoring | 24/7 | Business hours |

### Reliability Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Workflow Success Rate | **95% success** | 92% |
| Auto-Healing Coverage | **80% auto-heal** | 65% |
| Mean Time to Recovery | < 5 min | 8 min |

### Intelligence Targets

| Metric | Target | Current |
|--------|--------|---------|
| Prediction Accuracy | **85% accuracy** | 74.3% |
| False Positive Rate | < 5% | 8% |
| Proactive Interventions | 50% | 25% |

## Phase Breakdown

### Phase 1: Foundation (Week 1-2)

- Deploy enhanced monitoring to all 15 repositories
- Implement baseline auto-healing for common failure modes
- Establish prediction model v2 with improved accuracy

### Phase 2: Scale (Week 3-4)

- Roll out to remaining repositories
- Enable cross-repository pattern detection
- Implement resource pooling for efficiency

### Phase 3: Intelligence (Week 5-6)

- Deploy predictive pre-warming
- Enable intelligent scheduling
- Implement adaptive thresholds

### Phase 4: Optimization (Week 7-8)

- Fine-tune based on collected data
- Document lessons learned
- Plan Month 4 initiatives

## Success Criteria

1. Achieve 95% success rate across all monitored workflows
2. Reduce manual interventions by 80% through auto-heal
3. Maintain 85% accuracy in failure prediction
4. Cover all 15 repositories with full automation

## Risk Mitigation

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Model degradation | Weekly retraining schedule |
| Resource constraints | Elastic scaling with GitHub Actions |
| False positives | Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions |

## Timeline

```
Week 1-2:  Foundation setup and baseline
Week 3-4:  Scale deployment to 15 repos
Week 5-6:  Intelligence features enabled
Week 7-8:  Optimization and documentation
```

## Resources Required

- 2 FTE for implementation
- Additional compute for ML training
- Stakeholder buy-in for org-wide rollout

## Next Steps

1. Review and approve this plan
2. Allocate resources
3. Begin Phase 1 implementation
4. Weekly status updates to stakeholders
