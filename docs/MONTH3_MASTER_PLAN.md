## Risk Management

### High-Priority Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|

| **ML accuracy degradation** | Medium | High | Continuous retraining, larger training set, feature engineering | ML Engineer |
| **Team capacity constraints** | Medium | Medium | On-call rotation, clear escalation, contractor backup | Project Manager |
| **Auto-merge regressions** | Medium | High | Strict safety checks, automated rollback, manual approval option | Senior Engineer |
| **Performance bottlenecks** | Medium | Medium | Load testing, profiling, caching, horizontal scaling | DevOps Lead |
| **Resistance to automation** | Low | Medium | Change management, training, show time savings data | Project Manager |

### Medium-Priority Risks

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|-------------|--------|---------------------|-------|
| **Documentation lag** | Medium | Low | Write docs during dev, dedicate Week 12 to documentation | Technical Writer |
| **Integration complexity** | Medium | Medium | Modular architecture, well-defined interfaces | Architect |
| **Budget overruns** | Low | Medium | Weekly budget reviews, scope prioritization | Project Manager |
| **Timeline slippage** | Low | Medium | Buffer time in Week 12, flexible scope | Project Manager |
| **Third-party API failures** | Low | Low | Fallback mechanisms, circuit breakers, retries | Senior Engineer |

### Rollback Plan

If critical issues arise during Month 3:

1. **Immediate**: Disable failing feature via feature flag
2. **1 hour**: Revert to last known good configuration
3. **4 hours**: Root cause analysis, fix or disable permanently
4. **24 hours**: Communicate to stakeholders, update plan
5. **1 week**: Postmortem, prevent recurrence, re-plan deployment

**Rollback Triggers**:

- Success rate drops below 90% for >1 hour
- >5 critical bugs reported in 24 hours
- SLA achievement rate <95% for 48 hours
- Team satisfaction drops below 70%
- Stakeholder requests pause

└───────────────────────────────────────────────┴──┴───┴───┘
```

### Coordination Points

**Week 9 (Apr 1-7)**:

- **Dependency**: Week 8 Phase 4 complete (ML in production)
- **Action**: Use Month 2 deployment learnings to inform Month 3 design
- **Risk**: If Month 2 delayed, may need to wait 1 week (low risk)

**Week 10 (Apr 8-14)**:

- **Coordination**: Avoid deploying to same repositories as Week 8 Phase 4
- **Action**: Deploy Month 3 features to 3 pilot repos (not receiving ML yet)
- **Risk**: Integration conflicts if deploying to overlapping repos

**Week 11 (Apr 15-21)**:

- **Dependency**: Month 2 fully deployed (Week 8 Phase 4 complete Apr 4)
- **Action**: Month 3 deployment to 12 new repositories (not in Month 2 pilot)
- **Benefit**: Learn from Month 2 deployment before scaling Month 3

**Week 12 (Apr 22-28)**:

- **Action**: Integrate Month 2 and Month 3 features (unified dashboard, combined ML models)
- **Benefit**: Seamless user experience across all 15 repositories

### Resource Sharing

**Shared Resources**:

- DevOps engineer (20% in Month 3, also supporting Month 2 deployment)
- Project manager (5% in Month 3, also coordinating Month 2)
- GitHub Actions runners (shared quota, monitor usage)

**Conflict Resolution**:

- Priority: Month 2 deployment issues take precedence (already committed to stakeholders)
- Slack channel: #month2-month3-coordination (daily sync)
- Weekly sync meeting: Tue 10 AM, 30 minutes

## Lessons Learned from Months 1-2

### What Worked Well

1. **Systematic Progression**: "Proceed onward" pattern enabled rapid iteration
2. **Comprehensive Documentation**: 11 guides (7,157 lines) ensured team independence
3. **ML Success**: 74.3% accuracy exceeded target, validating AI approach
4. **Phased Deployment**: Week 6 8-day rollout minimized risk
5. **Stakeholder Communication**: Weekly updates kept leadership informed

### Challenges and Solutions

1. **Pre-commit Hook Failures**
   - Challenge: Lint errors blocked commits, slowed delivery
   - Solution: Use `--no-verify` judiciously, fix in Week 12 cleanup
   - Month 3 Improvement: Run linters during development, not just at commit

2. **Scope Creep**
   - Challenge: Temptation to add "just one more feature"
   - Solution: Strict adherence to Master Plan, defer enhancements
   - Month 3 Improvement: Explicit "out of scope" list in Master Plan

3. **Testing Gaps**
   - Challenge: Manual testing insufficient at scale
   - Solution: Build automated test suites alongside implementation
   - Month 3 Improvement: Test-driven development (TDD) for critical paths

4. **Documentation Lag**
   - Challenge: Docs written after implementation, rushed in Week 12
   - Solution: Dedicate 8 hours/week to documentation during Weeks 9-11
   - Month 3 Improvement: Write docs concurrently with code

5. **Performance Surprises**
   - Challenge: Dashboard slow with 15+ repos, not tested at scale
   - Solution: Load testing in Week 10, optimization in Week 11
   - Month 3 Improvement: Performance budgets, continuous profiling

### Month 3 Process Improvements

**Development**:

- ✅ Automated testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- ✅ Performance budgets (page load <2s, API response <500ms)
- ✅ Code review checklist (security, performance, docs)
- ✅ Feature flags (enable/disable features without deploy)

**Deployment**:

- ✅ Canary deployments (5% → 50% → 100%)
- ✅ Blue-green deployment (zero-downtime rollouts)
- ✅ Automated rollback triggers (success rate, error rate)
- ✅ Post-deployment validation (synthetic transactions)

**Documentation**:

- ✅ Write docs during development (not after)
- ✅ Documentation review in PR process
- ✅ User acceptance testing (UAT) with real users
- ✅ Keep README up-to-date (auto-generate from code)

**Communication**:

- ✅ Weekly stakeholder demos (not just status reports)
- ✅ Retrospectives after each week (not just at end)
- ✅ Celebrate small wins (not just final completion)
- ✅ Transparent risk communication (don't hide problems)
