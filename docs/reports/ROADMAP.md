# Project Roadmap

This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the development of our
AI-driven software development and automation framework. The roadmap is divided
into several phases, each with a specific focus, to guide our efforts in
enhancing the capabilities, usability, and adoption of the project.

## Phase 1: Foundation and Refinement (Short-Term)

This phase focuses on strengthening the core components of the framework,
improving the developer experience, and expanding our set of foundational agents
and integrations.

### 1.1. Core Framework & MCP

- **MCP Server Standardization:** Develop and document a clear specification for
  creating and deploying MCP servers, including boilerplate templates for common
  languages (Python, Node.js, Go).
- **Security Hardening:** Implement a more robust security model for MCP,
  including API key management and authentication/authorization mechanisms for
  agents to access tools.
- **Centralized Configuration:** Introduce a centralized configuration system
  for managing agents, chatmodes, and their permissions, simplifying
  organization-wide management.

### 1.2. Agent Development

- **Foundational Agents:** Develop a suite of "must-have" agents for common
  development tasks, such as:
  - A **Kubernetes Agent** for managing deployments and inspecting cluster
    state.
  - A **Database Schema Agent** for managing migrations and validating schema
    changes.
  - An **Observability Agent** to query metrics and logs from platforms like
    Prometheus, Grafana, or Datadog.
- **Agent Skill Library:** Create a shared library of "skills" (reusable
  functions or prompts) that can be easily incorporated into new agents,
  accelerating development.

### 1.3. User Experience & Onboarding

- **CLI Tool:** Develop a command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the
  framework, allowing users to:
  - List available agents and chatmodes.
  - Run agents directly from the command line.
  - Validate agent and MCP server configurations.
- **Improved Documentation:** Revamp the documentation to be more
  tutorial-focused, with clear, step-by-step guides for:
  - Creating your first agent.
  - Building and deploying an MCP server.
  - Using agents effectively in your daily workflow.

## Phase 2: Expansion and Integration (Mid-Term)

This phase is about expanding the reach of our framework by integrating with
more third-party tools and enhancing our automation capabilities.

### 2.1. Integrations

- **Ecosystem Expansion:** Develop and certify a wide range of MCP servers for
  popular third-party services, such as:
  - **Project Management:** Jira, Asana, Trello.
  - **Communication:** Slack, Microsoft Teams.
  - **CI/CD & SecOps:** SonarQube, Jenkins, JFrog Artifactory.
- **Official Docker Images:** Create and maintain official Docker images for our
  most popular MCP servers, simplifying deployment and ensuring consistency.

### 2.2. Workflow Automation

- **Agent-Triggered Workflows:** Enhance GitHub Actions to be triggered by
  agents. For example, an agent could analyze a security vulnerability and then
  trigger a workflow to automatically generate a patch and create a pull
  request.
- **Dynamic Workflow Generation:** Create workflows that can dynamically
  generate and execute other workflows based on the output of an agent's
  analysis.

### 2.3. Agent Development

- **Advanced Agent Patterns:** Begin implementing more complex agent
  collaboration patterns, as outlined in the architecture guide:
  - **Councils:** A group of agents that must "vote" on a decision before an
    action is taken (e.g., a "Release Council" approving a deployment).
  - **Swarms:** Multiple agents working in parallel to solve a complex problem.

## Phase 3: Intelligence and Autonomy (Long-Term)

This phase aims to realize the full potential of the framework by enabling
higher levels of intelligence and autonomous operation.

### 3.1. Core Framework & MCP

- **Agent Discovery Service:** Develop a centralized service where agents can
  dynamically discover and register available tools and MCP servers, moving
  beyond static configuration.
- **Self-Healing and Adaptation:** Explore mechanisms for agents to monitor
  their own performance and adapt their behavior over time, or even suggest
  improvements to their own prompts and instructions.

### 3.2. Observability & Monitoring

- **Agent Analytics Dashboard:** Create a centralized dashboard to visualize
  agent usage, performance metrics, and the overall health of the AI ecosystem.
- **Cost and ROI Tracking:** Implement features to track the operational cost of
  agents (e.g., token usage) and estimate the return on investment (e.g.,
  developer time saved).

### 3.3. Workflow Automation

- **Fully Autonomous Workflows:** Build end-to-end autonomous workflows for
  complex processes, such as:
  - **Automated Refactoring:** An agent that detects technical debt and
    autonomously carries out refactoring across multiple services.
  - **Autonomous Incident Response:** An agent that can not only detect and
    report an incident but also perform root cause analysis and apply
    remediation steps.

## Phase 4: Ecosystem and Community (Ongoing)

This is a continuous effort to grow a vibrant community around the project,
encouraging contributions and driving adoption.

### 4.1. Community Building

- **Contribution Guides:** Create comprehensive guides for contributing new
  agents, chatmodes, and MCP servers.
- **Open Source Showcase:** Establish a public repository or website to showcase
  community-contributed agents and integrations.
- **Community Forum:** Launch a Discord server or GitHub Discussions board to
  foster communication and collaboration among users and developers.

### 4.2. Documentation and Learning

- **Interactive Tutorials:** Develop interactive tutorials that guide users
  through building and using agents in a live, sandboxed environment.
- **Video Content:** Continue producing video walkthroughs, tutorials, and case
  studies to demonstrate the power and versatility of the framework.
