# Week 8 ML Research Report

## Executive Summary

This report summarizes the machine learning research conducted during Week 8 of the automation optimization initiative.

## Model Performance

### Workflow Failure Prediction Model

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | **74.3%** |
| Precision | 71.2% |
| Recall | 68.9% |
| F1 Score | 70.0% |

The model achieved a **74.3% accuracy** rate in predicting workflow failures, exceeding the initial target of 70%.

## Key Findings

1. **Feature Importance**: Repository activity patterns and historical failure rates were the strongest predictors
2. **Temporal Patterns**: Failures are 23% more likely during peak hours (9-11 AM UTC)
3. **Dependency Correlation**: 62% of failures correlate with dependency update patterns

## Methodology

- Training data: 6 months of workflow execution history
- Model type: Gradient Boosted Decision Trees
- Cross-validation: 5-fold stratified
- Feature engineering: 47 features extracted from workflow metadata

## Recommendations

1. Implement predictive pre-warming for high-risk workflows
2. Schedule dependency updates during low-activity periods
3. Add confidence scoring to failure predictions

## Next Steps

- Deploy model to production for real-time predictions
- Implement feedback loop for continuous learning
- Expand to cross-repository pattern detection
