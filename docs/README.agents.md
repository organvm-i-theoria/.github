# 🤖 Custom Agents

Custom agents for GitHub Copilot, making it easy for users and organizations to
"specialize" their Copilot coding agent (CCA) through simple file-based
configuration.

### How to Use Custom Agents

**To Install:**

- Click the **VS Code** or **VS Code Insiders** install button for the agent you
  want to use
- Download the `*.agent.md` file and add it to your repository

**MCP Server Setup:**

- Each agent may require one or more MCP servers to function
- Click the MCP server to view it on the GitHub MCP registry
- Follow the guide on how to add the MCP server to your repository

**To Activate/Use:**

- Access installed agents through the VS Code Chat interface, assign them in
  CCA, or through Copilot CLI (coming soon)
- Agents will have access to tools from configured MCP servers
- Follow agent-specific instructions for optimal usage
