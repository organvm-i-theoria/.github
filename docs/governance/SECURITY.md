# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We take security seriously and provide security updates for the following
versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| \< 1.0  | :x:                |

**Note:** Only the latest major version receives security updates. Please
upgrade to the latest version to ensure you have the latest security patches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

We strongly encourage responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities. If you
discover a security issue, please report it privately using one of the following
methods:

### Preferred Method: GitHub Security Advisories

1. Navigate to the repository's **Security** tab
1. Click **"Report a vulnerability"**
1. Fill out the advisory form with details about the vulnerability
1. Submit the report

GitHub Security Advisories allow us to:

- Discuss the vulnerability privately
- Collaborate on a fix
- Publish a CVE if needed
- Credit you for the discovery

**Report URL:**
[https://github.com/ivviiviivvi/.github/security/advisories/new](https://github.com/ivviiviivvi/.github/security/advisories/new)<!-- link:github.security_advisory -->

### Alternative: Security Contact Email

If you prefer email or cannot use GitHub Security Advisories, email us at:

**📧 security@ivviiviivvi.com**

Please include:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce
- Potential impact
- Any suggested fixes (optional)

## Response Timeline

We are committed to responding quickly to security reports:

| Timeline            | Action                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Within 24 hours** | Acknowledgment of your report                    |
| **Within 72 hours** | Initial assessment and severity classification   |
| **Within 7 days**   | Detailed response with remediation plan          |
| **Within 30 days**  | Fix deployed (for critical/high severity issues) |

Response times may vary based on:

- Severity of the vulnerability
- Complexity of the fix
- Need for coordinated disclosure with other parties

## Vulnerability Disclosure Process

1. **Report Received** - We acknowledge receipt within 24 hours
1. **Assessment** - We evaluate severity and impact (72 hours)
1. **Remediation** - We develop and test a fix
1. **Disclosure** - We coordinate disclosure timing with you
1. **Release** - We deploy the fix and publish an advisory
1. **Credit** - We publicly credit you (unless you prefer anonymity)

## Severity Classification

We use the [CVSS 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1) scoring system:

- **Critical (9.0-10.0)**: Immediate action required
- **High (7.0-8.9)**: Urgent fix needed
- **Medium (4.0-6.9)**: Important fix needed
- **Low (0.1-3.9)**: Minor issue

## Bug Bounty Program

**Status:** Coming Soon

We are planning to launch a bug bounty program to reward security researchers
who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities. Details will be published here when
available.

security@ivviiviivvi.com.

## Security Scanning Tools

We use the following automated security tools to detect vulnerabilities:

### Secret Detection

- **[TruffleHog](https://github.com/trufflesecurity/trufflehog)** - Scans for
  secrets, API keys, tokens
- **[Gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)** - Detects hardcoded
  credentials and sensitive data
- **[detect-secrets](https://github.com/Yelp/detect-secrets)<!-- link:github.detect_secrets -->**
  \- Prevents secrets from entering the codebase

### Dependency Scanning

- **[Dependabot](https://github.com/dependabot)<!-- link:github.dependabot -->**
  \- Automated dependency updates and security patches
- **[GitHub Advanced Security](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security)<!-- link:docs.github_code_security -->**
  \- Dependency vulnerability scanning

### Code Analysis

- **[CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/)** - Semantic code analysis for security
  vulnerabilities
- **[Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)** - Static analysis for security patterns

## Security Workflows

Our security workflows run automatically on every push and pull request:
