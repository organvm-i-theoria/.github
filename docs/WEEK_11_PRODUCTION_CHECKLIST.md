## Phase 1: Pilot Deployment (Day 1)

### Pre-Flight Checks

- [ ] **Repository Selection** (3 pilot repositories)
  - [ ] Repository 1: Low-risk, stable project
  - [ ] Repository 2: Medium activity, representative
  - [ ] Repository 3: Different team/type for diversity
  - [ ] All repositories validated as accessible
  - [ ] No critical deployments in progress

- [ ] **Configuration Review**
  - [ ] `automation/config/batch-onboard-pilot.yml` created
  - [ ] Repositories list verified (3 repos)
  - [ ] Workflow templates validated
  - [ ] Label configuration reviewed
  - [ ] Performance settings: concurrency=3 ✅
  - [ ] Rollback enabled: true ✅

- [ ] **Team Notification**
  - [ ] Stakeholders notified of deployment window
  - [ ] Repository owners informed
  - [ ] Support team on standby
  - [ ] Deployment timeline communicated

### Deployment Execution

```bash
# Step 1: Dry-run validation
python3 automation/scripts/batch_onboard_repositories.py \
  --config automation/config/batch-onboard-pilot.yml \
  --dry-run \
  --output pilot-dryrun.json

# Review dry-run results
cat pilot-dryrun.json | python3 -m json.tool
```
