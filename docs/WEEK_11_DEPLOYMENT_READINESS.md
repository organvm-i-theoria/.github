## Technical Resolution Summary

### Issue 1: Configuration Structure ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Nested structure incompatible with OnboardingConfig dataclass

**Resolution**:

- Simplified all configs to flat format
- Removed processing/monitoring/validation/metadata sections
- Validated against Week 10 working pattern

**Status**: All 3 phase configs using validated flat format

### Issue 2: Workflow Path Resolution ✅ RESOLVED

**Problem**: Hardcoded relative paths, couldn't find templates

**Resolution**:

```python
workspace_root = Path(__file__).parent.parent.parent
workflow_dirs = [
    workspace_root / "automation" / "workflow-templates",
    workspace_root / "workflow-templates",
    workspace_root / ".github" / "workflows"
]
```

**Impact**:

- Validation updated (lines 170-192)
- Deployment updated (lines 287-305)
- Multi-directory search with absolute paths

**Testing**: 100% success across all 3 phases

### Issue 3: Token Permissions ❌ EXTERNAL DEPENDENCY

**Problem**: GitHub Actions token lacks `issues: write`

**Impact**: Cannot create labels programmatically

**Workaround**: Manual deployment guide created (3 options)

**Status**: Awaiting user action (15 min via Web UI recommended)
