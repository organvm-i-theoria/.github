## Best Practices

1. **Plan Thoroughly**: Create comprehensive decommissioning plans
1. **Document Everything**: Maintain detailed records of all actions
1. **Verify Compliance**: Ensure all regulatory requirements are met
1. **Communicate Clearly**: Keep stakeholders informed throughout
1. **Preserve What's Needed**: Archive data before destruction
1. **Verify Deletion**: Confirm data is truly unrecoverable
1. **Update Inventory**: Keep asset management systems current
1. **Learn and Improve**: Conduct post-decommissioning reviews
1. **Automate**: Use scripts and tools for consistency
1. **Certify**: Issue certificates for compliance purposes

## Operational Guardrails and Critique

**Before teardown**

- **Retain only what's justified**: Challenge retention requests that lack a
  regulatory or contractual basis to avoid unnecessary archival bloat.
- **Dependency inventory**: Map downstream systems, backups, and DNS/identity
  dependencies to avoid collateral outages.
- **Timebox risky operations**: Schedule destructive steps with explicit
  maintenance windows, stakeholder acknowledgements, and fallback checkpoints.
- **Reversibility check**: Where policies require it, preserve recovery points
  and test restores in a controlled manner before proceeding with destruction.

**During teardown**

- **Prioritize evidence over assumptions**: Require verifiable deletion evidence
  (logs, cost reports, and API confirmations) before closing out a
  decommissioning effort.
- **Chain-of-custody rigor**: Track ownership for credentials, encryption keys,
  storage media, and certificates throughout the destruction workflow to prevent
  gaps in accountability.
- **Cost validation**: Pair resource termination with billing diffs to verify
  spend drops and to catch lingering orphaned services.
- **Third-party confirmations**: For vendor-managed resources, capture
  provider-issued destruction certificates or portal evidence instead of relying
  solely on internal notes.

**After teardown**

- **Audit-friendly messaging**: Document rationale, scope, controls, and
  evidence in language that maps to frameworks such as NIST SP 800-88 and SOC 2
  to withstand external scrutiny.
- **Residual risk review**: Confirm access revocation, DNS cleanup, and
  monitoring alerts for stragglers; schedule post-change reviews to validate no
  hidden dependencies remain.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Deleting without checking legal holds
- Inadequate notification to stakeholders
- Forgetting to export required data
- Missing dependent systems
- Incomplete credential revocation
- Orphaned cloud resources
- Insufficient deletion verification
- Poor documentation
- Rushing the process
- Ignoring compliance requirements
