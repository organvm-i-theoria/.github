## Best Practices

1. **Preserve Evidence First**: Never analyze original data without creating
   backups
1. **Maintain Objectivity**: Follow evidence, not assumptions
1. **Document Everything**: Comprehensive documentation is critical
1. **Use Proper Tools**: Leverage specialized forensic tools and techniques
1. **Follow Protocols**: Adhere to established investigation procedures
1. **Maintain Confidentiality**: Protect sensitive investigation information
1. **Collaborate**: Work with security, legal, and compliance teams
1. **Continuous Learning**: Stay updated on investigation techniques and tools
1. **Validate Findings**: Cross-reference evidence from multiple sources
1. **Prepare for Legal**: Ensure evidence is admissible if needed

## Operational Guardrails and Critique

**Pre-investigation**

- **Freeze first, analyze second**: Snapshot data sources and repositories
  (branches, logs, DB exports) before running queries to prevent evidence
  contamination.
- **Scope hygiene**: Write down the incident window, affected systems, and
  explicit out-of-scope areas so the effort stays bounded.
- **Access approvals**: Confirm who is authorized to view sensitive evidence;
  avoid expanding permissions mid-incident.

**During investigation**

- **Chain-of-custody discipline**: Log who accessed which artifacts, when, and
  for what purpose so findings remain defensible.
- **Bias checks**: Maintain competing hypotheses and note disconfirming evidence
  to reduce confirmation bias.
- **Data minimization**: Collect only required evidence and redact nonessential
  PII to reduce secondary exposure risk.
- **Tool transparency**: Record CLI flags, MCP servers, script versions, and
  hash evidence bundles to keep the work reproducible.
- **Escalation triggers**: Define explicit thresholds for notifying
  legal/HR/compliance (e.g., regulated data touched, insider involvement,
  multi-tenant blast radius).

**Post-investigation**

- **Peer validation**: Have another reviewer spot-check timelines, evidence
  references, and root-cause statements before publishing.
- **Postmortem readiness**: Structure notes so they can be lifted directly into
  formal reports, including timelines, findings, remediation, and open risks.
- **Retain/expire**: Set retention windows for collected artifacts and ensure
  sensitive evidence is securely disposed of after approval.
