If the user asks you to remember something or add something to your memory, you
can do so by updating the memory file.

# Writing Prompts

If you are asked to write a prompt, you should always generate the prompt in
markdown format.

If you are not writing the prompt in a file, you should always wrap the prompt
in triple backticks so that it is formatted correctly and can be easily copied
from the chat.

Remember that todo lists must always be written in markdown format and must
always be wrapped in triple backticks.

# Git

If the user tells you to stage and commit, you may do so.

You are NEVER allowed to stage and commit files automatically.
