        ## ⚠️ Important Security Notice
        
        **For serious security vulnerabilities, please DO NOT create a public issue.**

        - Low-severity security improvements
        - Security-related questions
        - Non-critical security enhancements
        
        **DO NOT include sensitive details** such as:
        - Exploitation code or proof-of-concepts
        - Credentials, tokens, or secrets
        - Detailed vulnerability specifics that could be exploited
        
        If in doubt, use private disclosure methods outlined in SECURITY.md.
