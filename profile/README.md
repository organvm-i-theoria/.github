# ORGAN-I: Theoria — Theory & Epistemology

_Epistemological frameworks and symbolic computing in Python_

> *θεωρία (theoria) — contemplation, seeing*
>
> The ancient Greek word for the act of beholding truth: not passive observation,
> but the disciplined practice of looking until structure reveals itself.

## What This Organ Does

ORGAN-I is the **epistemological foundation** of the eight-organ system. It houses frameworks for recursive reasoning, ontological architecture, knowledge representation, and conceptual research. Every system needs a theory of itself before it can create (ORGAN-II) or transact (ORGAN-III) — Theoria provides that self-knowledge.

The work here spans:

- **Recursive engines** — symbolic operating systems that model identity, myth, and ritual as computable processes
- **Ontological frameworks** — naming conventions, metadata systems, and governance architectures for autonomous systems
- **Epistemological tools** — knowledge extraction pipelines, cognitive archaeology, and multi-agent deliberation systems
- **Linguistic analysis** — computational rhetoric, narratological algorithms, and rhetorical operating system design

## Philosophy

Theory is not abstraction for its own sake. In the organ system, **theory precedes art, and art precedes commerce** — the I → II → III dependency flow. ORGAN-I produces the conceptual scaffolding that ORGAN-II transforms into creative artifacts and ORGAN-III operationalizes into products. No back-edges: commerce never dictates theory. This is a design constraint, not an accident.

The repositories here treat ideas as engineered artifacts: versioned, documented, and structured for reuse. A naming convention is infrastructure. A governance framework is a machine. A recursive engine is a living system.
