## DEBUGGING

- **Git Commit Issues:**
  - If commits are blocked due to pre-commit hook failures, especially with
    `mypy`, check for issues related to the `types-all` dependency in
    `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
  - The `mypy` hook may fail if it tries to install `types-all`, which depends
    on a yanked/nonexistent stub package (`types-pkg-resources`).
  - To resolve:
    - Remove or narrow the `types-all` dependency in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
      under the `mypy` hook. For example, delete
      `additional_dependencies: [types-all]` or replace it with only the stubs
      you actually need (e.g., `types-requests`, etc.).
    - Run `pre-commit clean && pre-commit install` (or just retry the commit;
      pre-commit will reinstall environments).
    - Optional: run `pre-commit autoupdate` to pull newer hook revisions, but
      the main issue is `types-all`.
  - After resolving the `types-all` issue, refresh the pre-commit environments
    and reinstall the hooks using: `pre-commit clean && pre-commit install`.
    Then, retry the commit.

- **Pre-commit Hook Failures:**
  - When pre-commit hooks fail, address the issues systematically:
    1. **Shell Scripts:** Ensure shell scripts have executable permissions
       (`chmod +x script_name.py`).
    1. **YAML Formatting:** Check `.bandit` for YAML syntax errors.
    1. **Markdown Formatting:** Use `mdformat` to fix markdown issues.
    1. **Python Linting:** Resolve `flake8` and `mypy` errors.
    1. **Shell Linting:** Address `shellcheck` issues.
    1. **Configuration Issues:** Resolve issues reported by `bandit` and
       `detect-secrets`.
  - For `detect-secrets` issues, try running `pre-commit autoupdate`.
  - If ESLint reports missing configuration, create an `.eslintrc.json` file.
    Example:
    ```json
    {
      "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es2021": true,
        "node": true
      },
      "extends": "eslint:recommended",
      "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaVersion": 12,
        "sourceType": "module"
      },
      "rules": {}
    }
    ```
  - To auto-fix formatting issues, stage all changes (`git add -u`) before
    committing.
  - If pre-commit hooks are causing persistent issues, temporarily bypass them
    using
    `git commit --no-verify -m "chore: fix pre-commit hook configuration issues"`
    (use with caution).

- **Comprehensive Pre-commit Troubleshooting:**
  - If facing multiple pre-commit failures, follow these steps:
    1. **Identify the Issues:** Carefully examine the pre-commit output to
       pinpoint the specific errors. These often include:
       - YAML syntax errors (e.g., in `.bandit` or `.pre-commit-config.yaml`)
       - Markdown formatting problems.
       - Python linting errors (flake8, mypy).
       - Shell script permission issues.
       - Configuration problems flagged by bandit or detect-secrets.
    1. **Address Shell Script Permissions:** Use `chmod +x script_name.py` to
       grant execute permissions to the relevant scripts. Example:
       ```bash
       chmod +x automation/scripts/ecosystem_visualizer.py
       chmod +x automation/scripts/update_agent_docs.py
       chmod +x automation/scripts/mouthpiece_filter.py
       chmod +x project_meta/context-handoff/context_generator.py
       ```
    1. **Update pre-commit hooks:** Run `pre-commit autoupdate` to update
       `detect-secrets` and other hooks.
    1. **Fix YAML Configuration:** Correct any YAML syntax errors. For example,
       a minimal `.bandit` configuration may look like:
       ```yaml
       ---
       exclude_dirs:
         - /tests/
         - /test/
         - .venv/
         - venv/
       ```
    1. **Create ESLint Configuration (if missing):** If ESLint reports a missing
       configuration, create an `.eslintrc.json` file:
       ```json
       {
         "env": {
           "browser": true,
           "es2021": true,
           "node": true
         },
         "extends": "eslint:recommended",
         "parserOptions": {
           "ecmaVersion": 12,
           "sourceType": "module"
         },
         "rules": {}
       }
       ```
    1. **Auto-Fix Formatting Issues:** Stage all changes (`git add -u`) and
       recommit to allow pre-commit to auto-fix formatting issues (YAML,
       Markdown, etc.).
    1. **Run All pre-commit checks:** Use `pre-commit run --all-files || true`
       to attempt auto-fixing all issues.
    1. **Add auto-fixes:** Use `git add -A` to stage the auto-fixed changes.
    1. **Commit:** Use
       `git commit -m "chore: fix pre-commit issues and format code"` to commit
       the staged changes.
    1. **Bypass (If Necessary):** If pre-commit hooks persist, temporarily
       bypass them using
       `git commit --no-verify -m "chore: commit all changes (pre-commit fixes to follow)"`.
       **Use this as a last resort.**

- **Pre-commit Hook Dependency Conflict:**
  - When pre-commit hooks fail due to dependency conflicts, especially with
    `mdformat`, update to a compatible version that works with GFM plugins.
  - Specifically, ensure that the `mdformat` hook in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
    is using a compatible revision and includes the necessary
    `additional_dependencies`.
  - Example:
    ```yaml
    # ...existing code...
    - repo: https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat
      rev: 0.7.17 # Compatible with gfm plugins
      hooks:
        - id: mdformat
          additional_dependencies:
            - mdformat-gfm>=0.3.5
            - mdformat-tables
            - mdformat-toc
      args: [--wrap, '120']
    # ...existing code...
    ```
  - **Resolution Steps:**
    1. **Examine Current Configuration:** Check the current `mdformat`
       configuration in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
    1. **Apply the Fix:** Update the `mdformat` configuration to use
       `rev: 0.7.17` and include `mdformat-gfm>=0.3.5`, `mdformat-tables`, and
       `mdformat-toc` in `additional_dependencies`. Ensure
       `args: [--wrap, '120']` is also present.
    1. **Check for Rapid Config:** If `.pre-commit-config-rapid.yaml` exists,
       apply the same fix to it.
    1. **Clean and Reinstall:** Run `pre-commit clean`, `pre-commit install`,
       and
       `pre-commit autoupdate --repo https://github.com/executablebooks/mdformat`.
    1. **Test the Fix:** Run `pre-commit run mdformat --all-files` and
       `pre-commit run --all-files` to verify the fix.
    1. **Update Documentation:** Remove any `--no-verify` workarounds from
       `docs/`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `README.md`, and `CLEANUP_ROADMAP.md`.
    1. **Commit the Fix:** Stage the changes and commit with the message:
       `fix: update mdformat to v0.7.17 for gfm plugin compatibility - Update mdformat from 1.0.0 to 0.7.17 - Maintains compatibility with mdformat-gfm>=0.3.5 - Fixes pre-commit hook dependency conflict - Resolves CLEANUP_ROADMAP Phase 1.1 - Closes #[issue-number] The previous version (1.0.0) was incompatible with mdformat-gfm plugins, forcing developers to use --no-verify and bypass quality gates. Testing: - ✅ pre-commit run --all-files passes - ✅ mdformat hook executes successfully - ✅ All markdown files formatted correctly`.

- **Directory Case Sensitivity Issues:**
  - To prevent future merge conflicts, standardize directory casing.
  - Consolidate directories to lowercase. Example: Consolidate `Jules` to
    `jules`.
  - Update all workflow references to use the lowercase directory name.
  - Add the uppercase directory name to `.gitignore`.

## Code Review Workflow Rules

When performing a code review, pay close attention to the following:

- **Security:**
  - High - If an iframe embed runs with
    `sandbox="allow-scripts allow-same-origin ..."`, flag it. Allowing both
    script execution and same-origin breaks the sandbox boundary, so a
    compromised demo can read or inject content into the parent gallery. The
    sandbox should be tightened or the content proxied.

* **Deployment Registry and Data Aggregation:**
  - High - Ensure that deployment workflows are not overwriting a central YAML
    file (`app-deployments.yml`) inside the source repo, especially if the
    gallery is in a separate `.github` repo and the index job only queries
    GitHub APIs. Commits to the source repo will not reach the gallery site, and
    the deployment registry will remain empty, preventing live demos from being
    surfaced in the UI.

## Stash Management Rules

When encountering a large number of stashed changes and ongoing issues:

- **Triage Plan:**
  - When there are a large number of stashed changes, start with a triage plan.
  - Gather concise `git status`.
  - Summarize stashes.
  - Prioritize which stashes to address.

- **Triage Options:**
  - Collect `git status` and a stash inventory summary (count + newest/oldest
    entries).
  - Focus on active issues that need fixing - ask the user to specify the issues
    or failing workflow.
  - Prune stale stashes after backing up important ones.

- **Execution:**
  - When handling a large number of stashed changes and ongoing issues with
    autonomous approval:
    - Run `git status -sb` to get the current working tree status.
    - Summarize stashes using:
      `(git stash list | head -n 5; echo '---'; git stash list | tail -n 5; echo '---count---'; git stash list | wc -l)`.

#### Phase 2: Documentation Consolidation (Priority: 🟡 HIGH)

### 2.1 Consolidate Duplicate Documentation
  - Compare content of three ROADMAP files
  - Keep docs/ROADMAP.md as canonical
  - Move workflow-specific content
  - Add redirect/deprecation notices
  - Update internal links
  - Create docs/INDEX.md

### 2.2 Restructure Documentation Hierarchy
  - Create docs/INDEX.md master index
  - Reorganize files into subdirectories (guides/, reference/, workflows/, audits/, architecture/)
  - Update cross-references
  - Add navigation breadcrumbs

### 2.3 Update Root-Level Documentation
  - Add badges to README.md
  - Create visual architecture diagram
  - Add quickstart section
  - Update contact emails
  - Add "Last Updated" footer
  - Create CHANGELOG.md

## Phase 3: Code & Script Cleanup (Priority: 🟡 HIGH)
- Timeline: 5-7 days
- Owner: Engineering Team

The phase includes:
1. **3.1 Consolidate Agent Tracking Systems** - Document purpose of agent trackers, consolidate to single .jules/ directory, create docs, add validation tests
2. **3.2 Audit and Optimize Python Scripts** - Add docstrings, run mypy --strict, achieve 80%+ test coverage, remove deprecated scripts, create README
3. **3.3 Shell Script Cleanup** - Run shellcheck, add error handling, add usage/help messages, document env vars
