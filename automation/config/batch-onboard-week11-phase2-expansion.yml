# Week 11 Production Deployment - Phase 2: Expansion (8 Total Repositories)
#
# Purpose: Expand deployment after pilot validation
# Timeline: Day 3 (after 48-hour pilot monitoring)
# Expected Duration: ~46 seconds (8 repos × 5.78s)
# Risk Level: Low-Medium (includes pilot repos + 5 new)
# Success Criteria: 100% deployment success, pilot repos stable
